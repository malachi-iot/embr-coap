# Overview

So many different retry attempts.  This folder does not attempt to
end the cycle, but does attempt to organize portions so that they can be
reused if they pass muster

## Detail

Code here need not be absolutely specific to retry - its focus is reusability
in the context of retry.
### Requirements

Code in this folder refers to the bibliography in this README
Due to complexity of retry and scheduling, c++11 is required
