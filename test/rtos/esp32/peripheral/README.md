# Peripheral

This app started as a boilerplate for observer-subject + streambuf boilerplate, but has grown out of that scope

Still, it's a good starting point for a full CoAP app

## Test Results

See parent folder README.md for result summary

These tests are generally performed:

1. "ping" test to get a 404 from the root
2. v1/sys and/or v1/sys/firmware/version for deeper verification
